<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>“The [White Sox will have set a new record for futility, losses… There is beauty in losing, gravitas in losing — lessons to be learned in losing.” <br>
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-beauty-of-the-chicago-white-soxs-abysmal-season.html">— Will Leitch, New York Magazine</a></p>

<p>If you’re a sports fan, you know that sinking feeling well -- a particularly stinging loss sending you into hours, or even days, of malaise. After a string of defeats, you may feel like you're the subject of some karmic retribution. You might try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Billy_Penn">break a curse</a>, or perhaps try <a href="https://x.com/MenInBlazers/status/1191050823758954496">sleeping off</a> the disappointment of sports heartbreak. On the other hand, all sports fans know the unmistakable joy of waking up the morning after a big win, reliving every moment of the game in their imagination. However, there’s research that suggests fans feel <a href="https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/sports-make-you-miserable-science-says.html">losses more strongly</a> than the wins.</p>

<p>So which cities have had it worst (and best)? I analyzed the regular seasons (1969-2024) of all teams in the “Big 4” American sports leagues (NBA, NHL, MLB, and NFL) to assess the semi-objective amount of misery or joy experienced by each city’s fans.</p>

<p>While all sports fans have endured some tough losses, some have had it worse than others. In 2024, Chicago teams had a markedly awful run:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The White Sox nearly set a low-water mark for modern baseball, finishing with a record of 41-121. They barely avoided further ignominy, as their winning percentage was slightly higher than the hapless 1962 Mets.</li>
  <li>The Bears went 5-12 and finished last in their division, only two wins better than the worst record in the league.</li>
  <li>The Blackhawks were the second-worst team in the NHL, finishing only five points ahead of the bottom-feeding San Jose Sharks.</li>
  <li>The Bulls made the postseason via the NBA play-in tournament, but were knocked out of that competition by the Miami Heat. They had a negative record at 39-43.</li>
  <li>The Cubs were the sole Chicago team with a positive record, but only barely: they finished 83-79 and missed the postseason by a substantial margin.</li>
</ul>

<p>To nobody’s surprise, Chicago’s 2024 in sports was abjectly miserable. In fact, a coworker reasonably suggested that it was the worst time to be a fan of any city. However, it was only the second-worst year for any city since 1969.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>Comparing records across sports is not entirely straightforward. In the NFL, exceptional teams often win (or lose) nearly every game in a season. Baseball has higher variance in the course of a game, so MLB teams typically achieve higher peaks and lower nadirs -- even the historically hapless 2024 White Sox achieved a winning percentage of .253, higher than the winning percentage of five NFL teams in the same year.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="images/image1.png" alt="Chart comparing MLB and NFL">
  <p class="caption">MLB winning percentages tend to cluster around .500, while NFL winning percentages have considerably greater spread.</p>
</div>

<p>To further complicate comparisons, the NHL has a point system where teams are assigned two points for a win (regulation or overtime) and one point for an overtime loss. Standings are determined by teams’ point total. For that reason, I evaluated NHL teams by point percentage rather than win percentage.</p>

<p>Fortunately, standard deviation, a relatively simple and old-fashioned statistical technique helps to contextualize individual teams’ records. The standard deviation is the average distance of each point in a dataset from the mean of the dataset. To apply standard deviations to teams’ seasons, I calculated the standard deviation of teams’ winning percentages for every sport in every season. This allowed me to calculate each team’s standard deviations above or below their league’s mean winning percentage for that season. In statistics, these values are known as z-scores.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="images/image3.png" alt="Chart of normalized z-scores">
  <p class="caption">After normalization, the NFL and MLB have similar distributions, allowing for a more direct comparison.</p>
</div>

<p>Comparing cities’ calendar years is also straightforward, as I can sum (or average) the teams in each city for each year. For the purpose of this article, each year includes the NBA and NHL season ending in that year, the MLB season taking place entirely in that year, and NFL season beginning in that year.</p>

<h2>The Bad: 2024, Chicago</h2>

<p>Revisiting Chicago’s catastrophic 2024, the teams’ combined Z-Scores add up to the second-worst sports year experienced by any city since at least 1969. Only Detroit in 2020 had a worse year.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="images/image4.png" alt="Chicago sports z-scores">
  <p class="caption">None of the 5 teams were above the median record for their respective league, and only the Cubs finished above their league’s mean record.</p>
</div>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at the White Sox. Their Z-Score was -3.2 -- an average team would achieve that Z-Score by chance only 7 times in 10,000 seasons!</p>
<p>This was the worst Z-Score in any MLB season since at least 1969 by a significant margin. The second-worst MLB team, the 2003 Tigers, stumbled to a historically poor season of their own in 2003, but still achieved a Z-Score of -2.84.</p>

<h2>The Ugly: Detroit’s Unparalleled Sports Misery in 2020</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Pistons went 20-46 in the NBA’s COVID-shortened season.</li>
  <li>The Red Wings managed only 39 points — the worst normalized season of any analyzed.</li>
  <li>The Tigers went 23-35 in a 60-game season.</li>
  <li>The Lions won 5 and lost 11 games.</li>
</ul>

<p>The NBA, MLB, and NHL seasons were all curtailed due to the COVID pandemic. Despite that, the results from Detroit’s teams are highly anomalous:</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="images/image8.png" alt="Detroit 2020">
</div>

<p>The Red Wings’ exceptionally low Z-Score reflects a massive gap between them and the rest of the NHL. The result: no team since 1969 has had a worse Z-Score than the 2020 Red Wings squad.</p>

  <p class="caption">Without the Cubs, 2024 Chicago teams’ Z-Scores add up to -6.47, only slightly higher than 2020 Detroit’s -6.51</p>

<h2>The Good: Philadelphia’s Great Year and Great Photo</h2>

<p>Philadelphia is known for passionate sports fans, but its teams have not always enjoyed much success. The Phillies, for instance, have the most losses and fourth-worst winning percentage of all active MLB teams. Yet in 1980, every Philadelphia sports team made it to their league’s championship competition, with the Phillies winning their first ever World Series. It should be no surprise that Philadelphia’s 1980 was the most successful year for any city since 1969 (at least in the regular season). The four Philadelphia teams achieved the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The 76ers had the third-best NBA record, lost in the Finals.</li>
  <li>The Flyers won the President’s Trophy and reached the Stanley Cup Finals.</li>
  <li>The Phillies won their first World Series after 98 seasons.</li>
  <li>The Eagles went 12-4 and made the Super Bowl.</li>
</ul>

<div class="center">
  <img src="images/image9.png" alt="Philly team stats">
  <p class="caption">All four Philadelphia teams enjoyed unusually successful regular seasons.</p>
</div>

<p>When using mean Z-Score (excluding cities with only 1–2 teams), Houston’s 2018 was the most successful season.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Is there “beauty in losing,” as Will Leitch suggests in his review of the 2024 White Sox? I would tend to agree. The rollercoaster of sports fandom requires losing as well as winning, and sometimes, well, those losses pile up. Chicago fans can hold their heads high knowing that one city had it even worse. Detroit fans can be happy that better days have already come -- the Lions are one of the best teams in football and Tigers have the second-best record in baseball (as of June 29th, 2025).</p>
