  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “The [White Sox will have set a new record for futility, losses… There is beauty in losing, gravitas in losing — lessons to be learned in losing.”<br>

  <p>If you're a sports fan, you know that sinking feeling well -- a particularly stinging loss sending you into hours, or even days, of malaise. After a string of defeats, you may feel like you're the subject of some karmic retribution. You might try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Billy_Penn">break a curse</a>, or perhaps try <a href="https://x.com/MenInBlazers/status/1191050823758954496">sleeping off</a> the disappointment of sports heartbreak. However, there’s research that suggests fans feel <a href="https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/sports-make-you-miserable-science-says.html">losses more strongly</a> than the wins.</p>

  <p>So which cities have had it worst (and best)? I analyzed the regular seasons (1969–2024) of all teams in the “Big 4” American sports leagues (NBA, NHL, MLB, and NFL) to assess the semi-objective amount of misery or joy experienced by each city’s fans.</p>

  <p>While all sports fans have endured some tough losses, some have had it worse than others. In 2024, Chicago teams had a markedly awful run:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The White Sox nearly set a low-water mark for modern baseball, finishing 41-121.</li>
    <li>The Bears went 5-12 and finished last in their division.</li>
    <li>The Blackhawks were second-worst in the NHL.</li>
    <li>The Bulls lost in the play-in tournament and had a 39-43 record.</li>
    <li>The Cubs were the only team with a winning record at 83-79, but still missed the postseason.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To nobody’s surprise, Chicago’s 2024 in sports was abjectly miserable. In fact, a coworker reasonably suggested that it was the worst time to be a fan of any city. However, it was only the second-worst year for any city since 1969.</p>

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Comparing records across sports is not entirely straightforward. In the NFL, teams often win or lose nearly every game. Baseball has higher variance, so MLB teams typically achieve higher highs and lower lows.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="images/image1.png" alt="Winning Percentages Comparison">
    <div class="caption">MLB winning percentages tend to cluster around .500, while NFL winning percentages have considerably greater spread.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The NHL uses a points system (2 for a win, 1 for an OT loss), so I evaluated teams by point percentage instead of win percentage.</p>

  <p>I calculated the z-score (standard deviation from league mean) for each team’s winning percentage to normalize across leagues and seasons.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="images/image3.png" alt="Normalized Scores">
    <div class="caption">After normalization, the NFL and MLB have similar distributions, allowing for a more direct comparison.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Each year includes NBA/NHL seasons ending in that year, the MLB season entirely in that year, and NFL season beginning that year.</p>

  <h2>The Bad: 2024, Chicago</h2>
  <p>Chicago’s 2024 Z-Score total was the second-worst since 1969, behind only Detroit in 2020.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="images/image4.png" alt="Chicago 2024">
    <div class="caption">None of the 5 teams were above the median record, only the Cubs beat the league mean.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The White Sox had a Z-Score of -3.2 — worse than any MLB team since 1969, including the 2003 Tigers.</p>

  <h2>The Ugly: Detroit’s Unparalleled Sports Misery in 2020</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Pistons went 20-46.</li>
    <li>The Red Wings had the worst season of any team analyzed.</li>
    <li>The Tigers went 23-35 in a 60-game season.</li>
    <li>The Lions finished 5-11.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="images/image8.png" alt="Detroit 2020">
  </div>

  <p>The Red Wings had the worst Z-Score of any team in the dataset.</p>

  <p>Without the Cubs, Chicago’s 2024 Z-Score drops even further.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="images/image5.png" alt="Chicago Without Cubs">
    <div class="caption">Without the Cubs, 2024 Chicago teams’ Z-Scores total -6.47, nearly matching Detroit 2020’s -6.51.</div>

  <h2>The Good: Philadelphia’s Great Year and Great Photo</h2>

  <div class="center">

  <ul>
    <li>76ers reached NBA Finals.</li>
    <li>Flyers won President’s Trophy, reached Stanley Cup Finals.</li>
    <li>Phillies won their first World Series.</li>
    <li>Eagles made it to the Super Bowl.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="images/image9.png" alt="Philly Team Success">
    <div class="caption">All four Philadelphia teams enjoyed unusually successful regular seasons.</div>

  <p>On average team performance, Houston in 2018 barely beats out Philadelphia 1980.</p>

    <div class="caption">Houston 2018’s average success (1.5) is the highest of all cities, just above Philadelphia in 1980 (1.4).</div>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Is there “beauty in losing,” as Will Leitch suggests? Maybe. The rollercoaster of sports fandom requires both. Chicago fans can find solace in knowing one city had it worse. Detroit fans — the future is already brighter.</p>
